# Installation

## CDN

You can use OctoFetch from a popular CDN. This is ideal for trying out OctoFetch or including it inside a project that does not have a bundler:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/octofetch/dist/octofetch.min.js"></script>
```

If you are using native ES Modules, there is an ESM compatible build:

```html
<script type="module">
    import octofetch from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/octofetch/dist/octofetch.min.js";
</script>
```

## NPM

You can easily pull octofetch from NPM:

```
npm install octofetch --save
```

## Yarn

You can also use Yarn instead of NPM:

```
yarn add octofetch
```
